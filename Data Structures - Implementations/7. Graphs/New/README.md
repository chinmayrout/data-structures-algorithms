What in Graph?

1. Adjacency List + BFS and DFS of adjacency List
2. Matrix Representation + BFS and DFS of Matrix
3. Basic Heap knowlegde
4. Union-Find
5. Segment Tree
6. Dijkstra's
7. Prim's and Kruskal's
8. Topological Sort
9. Bellman Ford
10. Multi-source BFS - Walls and Gates problem

Basics

1. LINKED-LIST AND TREES ARE SUB-SETS OF GRAPHS
2. NODES CAN BE CALLED AS VERTICES AND POINTERS CONNECTING NODES ARE CALLED EDGES
3. GRAPHS CAN BE OF ALL KINDS OF SHAPES
4. THEY CAN HAVE CYCLES, THEY HAVE NO RESTRICTIONS, node/vertex can point to itself(self-loop)
5. ONE RESTRICTION -> E <= V^2; E IS NO. OF EDGES AND V IS No of Vertices
6. Directed Graph - Edges have direction
7. Trees and Linked List are un-directed graph(both way you can go)
