Binary Trees

1. Parent and left-child and right-child.
2. Child-less nodes are called leaf-nodes
3. Top of Binary tree are called root
4. Binary Tree can't have cycles
5. All node has to be connected.
6. Hieght of node - Single node - 1, Longest path till finding a child node
7. Depth of - Root node -1, first child - 2, third descendent - 3
8. Descendent - child node, for root - every node is descendend
9. Ancestor - parent node
10.

Binary Search Tree - Exactly like Binary Tree, almost sorted

1. Every single node in tree, every single node in left sub-tree is less value
   and every single node in right-sub-tree is more
2. Almost in most cases, no duplicates
3. log(n) to search in average case OR O(h) - height of tree
   Why Binary Search Tree? -> Adding and removing in BST is easier than sorted array
