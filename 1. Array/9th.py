#Minimize the maximum difference between the heights

#Given heights of n towers and a value k. We need to either increase or decrease height of every tower by k (only once) where k > 0. 
# The task is to minimize the difference between the heights of the longest and the shortest tower after modifications, and output this difference.

#Python program to find the minimum possible difference
